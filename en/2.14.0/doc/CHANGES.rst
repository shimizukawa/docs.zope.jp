- Dropped the direct dependencies on packages that have been factored out of
  the main Zope 2 tree. Make sure you declare a dependency in your own
  distribution if you still use one of these: ``Products.BTreeFolder2``,
  ``Products.ExternalMethod``, ``Products.MailHost``, ``Products.MIMETools``,
  ``Products.PythonScripts`` or ``Products.StandardCacheManagers``.
